warning: Whitespace calculations for indentation stripping in a multiline ''-string include the first line, so putting text on it will effectively disable all indentation stripping. To fix this, simply break the line right after the string starts. Use --extra-deprecated-features broken-string-indentation to silence this warning.

warning: Whitespace in a ''-string will be stripped even if the string only has a single line, which is most likely not the intent of the code. To fix this, remove the whitespace or replace the string with " instead. Use --extra-deprecated-features broken-string-indentation to silence this warning.
