Following the initial mitigation of **CVE-2025-52992** in `cl/3444`, we
received reports of **unexpected deletion of in-use store paths**.

Upon investigation, we found that the patch did **not correctly cancel all
automatic deleters**, resulting in potentially critical path loss during normal
operation.

Given the severity and time-sensitive nature of the situation ([see incident
report](https://lix.systems/blog/2025-06-27-lix-critical-bug/)), we evaluated
possible options to repair the behavior safely. However, we concluded that a
rushed fix would either

* **Overdelete**, i.e. breaking running systems, or,
* **Underdelete**, effectively **reopening CVE-2025-52992** while leaving
  orphaned paths behind.

As **CVE-2025-52992 has no known exploit vector**, and correctness is critical
in the Lix project, we have **fully reverted the previous mitigations**.

The affected patches (`cl/3444`) have been rolled back for the time being.

Moving forward, the Lix team will rework this code path in a **long-term,
correctness-first fix** on the main branch. We will explore backporting it to
stable channels once its safety is assured.

We are deeply sorry for the stability incident and the Lix team remain
available for assisting you in recovering your systems.
