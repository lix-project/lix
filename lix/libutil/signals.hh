 * Processes are expected to be simple, mostly just calling execve.
 * All processes should call restoreProcessContext(), possibly with
 * `false` (depends on whether mounts should be restored), which will unmask
 * SIGINT and other signals that were previously masked in an advanced process
 * such as the one that started them, so the process can be interrupted.
 *
 * It is generally a mistake to fork a process without at least calling
 * restoreSignals() or restoreProcessContext().
